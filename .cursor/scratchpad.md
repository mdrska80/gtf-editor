# GTF Editor Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

- **Project Type:** Frontend application likely for editing GTF (Glyph/Font?) files.
- **Technology Stack:** Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify (UI library), Tauri (for potential desktop builds).
- **Initial Goal:** Understand the project structure, how to run it, and propose potential next steps or features.
- **Current State:** Basic understanding of the tech stack and how to run the development server (`npm run dev`) or Tauri app (`npm run tauri dev`) after `npm install`.
- **New Goal (January 2025):** Comprehensive code refactoring to improve maintainability, performance, and code quality based on identified technical debt.
- **CRITICAL ISSUE (January 2025):** Large glyph performance bottleneck identified. User needs to create 160x32 glyph (5,120 cells) but current DOM-based implementation will have horrible performance. Requires immediate optimization strategy.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Understanding GTF:** (Status: Done)
- **Tauri Integration:** (Confirmed: Tauri is used for file dialogs and backend Rust logic.)
- **UI Implementation:** **(Update: Core UI components (Header Editor, Glyph Editor, Palette Editor, Bitmap Grid, File Ops, Language Check, Glyph List/Preview) are implemented and functional.)**
- **State Management:** (Update: State managed in `App.vue` via `ref` and computed properties, passed down via props, updates handled via emitted events. Seems functional for current features.)

- **Incomplete Features:** **(Update: Based on user feedback and re-evaluation, all core features including Bitmap Resizing seem to be implemented. Focus shifts to refinements and new features.)**
- **Defining "Beautiful/Vibrant/Alive":** These terms are subjective. We need to translate them into concrete design choices (colors, spacing, animations, interactions).
- **Technology Stack:** **(Confirmed: Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify 3)** The project uses Vite, Vue 3, and the Vuetify 3 component library. This means we should leverage Vuetify's theming capabilities (including built-in light/dark mode support) and potentially customize its components rather than starting CSS from scratch. Animations might be handled via Vuetify's transitions or custom CSS. The presence of Tauri suggests a desktop app context, which might influence some choices (e.g., native-like elements or custom).
- **Global Application:** Applying styles globally requires careful planning. Vuetify's theme system helps, but we need to ensure custom styles integrate well and don't conflict.
- **Theme Switching:** Vuetify provides mechanisms for theme switching, simplifying this task. We need to configure the light/dark palettes within Vuetify's theme settings.

**NEW REFACTORING ANALYSIS (January 2025):**

### Code Quality Issues Identified:
1. **Build Warning**: Large chunks (546KB JS bundle) indicate potential for code splitting
2. **Component Size**: `GlyphEditor.vue` is 15KB/447 lines - too large and complex
3. **Commented Code**: Multiple sections of commented-out code in `App.vue` should be cleaned up
4. **Repeated Logic**: Palette processing logic repeated across components
5. **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded values like cell sizes, color codes scattered throughout
6. **State Management**: Theme state (`isDarkMode`) not in central store, inconsistent state patterns
7. **Performance**: No lazy loading for heavy components, no virtualization for large glyph lists
8. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across components
9. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels and proper accessibility patterns
10. **Type Safety**: No TypeScript - pure JavaScript without type checking

### Technical Debt Areas:
1. **Prop Drilling**: Deep prop passing chains, especially in palette data
2. **Event Bubbling**: Complex event emission chains that could be simplified
3. **Computed Properties**: Heavy computations in templates, not optimized
4. **Watchers**: Complex watchers that could be refactored into reactive patterns
5. **CSS Organization**: Scoped styles mixed with global styles, no design system
6. **File Organization**: No clear separation between UI components, business logic, and utilities

## High-level Task Breakdown (REFACTORING PLAN)

### Phase 1: Code Structure & Organization (Priority: High)
1. **Clean up App.vue**: Remove commented code, extract remaining UI logic
   - *Success Criteria:* App.vue under 150 lines, no commented code blocks
2. **Break down GlyphEditor.vue**: Split into smaller, focused components
   - *Success Criteria:* No single component over 200 lines, clear separation of concerns
3. **Create centralized theme management**: Move theme state to store/composable
   - *Success Criteria:* Single source of truth for theme, consistent across app
4. **Establish design system constants**: Extract magic numbers and repeated values
   - *Success Criteria:* Constants file with sizing, colors, spacing values

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (Priority: Medium)
5. **Implement code splitting**: Split large components and use dynamic imports
   - *Success Criteria:* JS bundle under 300KB, faster initial load
6. **Add virtual scrolling**: For large glyph lists and bitmap grids
   - *Success Criteria:* Smooth performance with 500+ glyphs
7. **Optimize computed properties**: Memoization and reactive optimizations
   - *Success Criteria:* No unnecessary re-computations, better responsiveness
8. **Lazy load heavy components**: Load editor components on demand
   - *Success Criteria:* Faster app startup, smaller initial bundle

### Phase 3: Code Quality & Maintainability (Priority: Medium)
9. **Standardize error handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user feedback
   - *Success Criteria:* All errors caught and displayed consistently
10. **Add comprehensive type checking**: Consider TypeScript migration or JSDoc
    - *Success Criteria:* Type safety for critical data structures
11. **Implement proper testing**: Unit tests for composables and utilities
    - *Success Criteria:* 80% coverage for business logic
12. **Accessibility improvements**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
    - *Success Criteria:* WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Priority: Low)
13. **Setup linting and formatting**: ESLint, Prettier configuration
    - *Success Criteria:* Consistent code style, automated formatting
14. **Add development tools**: Vue devtools integration, debugging helpers
    - *Success Criteria:* Easier debugging and development workflow
15. **Documentation improvements**: Code documentation, architecture diagrams
    - *Success Criteria:* Clear documentation for new developers

### Phase 5: CRITICAL - Large Glyph Performance Optimization (Priority: URGENT)

**PROBLEM ANALYSIS:**
- Current `BitmapGrid.vue` creates individual DOM elements for each cell
- 160x32 glyph = 5,120 DOM elements with complex styling, event handlers, animations
- Performance will be catastrophic: slow rendering, laggy interactions, high memory usage
- Current optimizations (virtual scrolling, memoization) don't address bitmap editor performance

**ROOT CAUSE:**
- DOM-based cell rendering doesn't scale beyond ~500-1000 cells
- Complex CSS hover effects and transitions on each cell
- Individual event listeners on thousands of elements
- CSS Grid layout performance degrades with large grids

16. **Implement Canvas-Based Bitmap Renderer**: Replace DOM grid with HTML5 Canvas for large bitmaps
    - *Success Criteria:* Smooth performance with 160x32 (5,120 cells), 60fps interactions
    - *Technical Approach:* Canvas renderer with viewport culling, batched drawing operations
    - *Fallback Strategy:* Keep DOM renderer for small glyphs (<500 cells)

17. **Add Intelligent Rendering Mode Detection**: Automatically switch between DOM and Canvas based on glyph size
    - *Success Criteria:* Seamless transition, optimal performance for all glyph sizes
    - *Threshold:* DOM for â‰¤20x20 (400 cells), Canvas for larger glyphs

18. **Implement Viewport-Based Interaction Handling**: Canvas-based mouse interaction with pixel-accurate hit detection
    - *Success Criteria:* Precise drawing, hover effects, drag operations on Canvas
    - *Features:* Real-time cursor tracking, drawing mode persistence, undo/redo support

19. **Optimize Memory Management**: Efficient bitmap data structures and garbage collection
    - *Success Criteria:* Low memory footprint for large bitmaps, no memory leaks
    - *Implementation:* Typed arrays, object pooling, efficient string operations

20. **Add Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and optimization hints
    - *Success Criteria:* FPS monitoring, memory usage tracking, automatic performance warnings
    - *User Feedback:* Performance indicators in UI, recommendations for optimal settings

## Lessons

*(Learnings and reusable notes will be documented here)*
- GTF v2 is a text format with HEADER/GLYPH blocks. Specification file: `glyph_format_spec_v2.md`.
- Core parsing/saving logic exists in Rust (`src-tauri/src/gtf.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) via `load_gtf_file` and `save_gtf_file` Tauri commands.
- Visual bitmap editor `BitmapGrid.vue` IS implemented.
- `SPECIFICATION.md` checklist is outdated **and the file has been removed**. This scratchpad (`.cursor/scratchpad.md`) is now the primary source for task tracking and project status.
- File Ops (Open, Save, Save As, New File) implemented in `App.vue` / `FileOperations.vue`.
- Add/Remove Glyphs implemented in `App.vue`.
- Header/Glyph Metadata/Palette editing logic implemented via component events handled in `App.vue`.
- Sidebar glyph list provides Character Map/Overview functionality with grouping and preview (`App.vue`, `GlyphPreview.vue`).
- Bitmap resizing logic IS implemented (User confirmed).
- **All core spec features seem implemented.** Focus is now on refinement/new features.
- Identified frontend stack: Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify 3.
- Language check uses hardcoded sets in `App.vue`, interaction simplified to click-to-edit/add.
- Achieving consistent custom `box-shadow` appearance across light/dark themes is difficult. Vuetify's `elevation` classes are the preferred method, but didn't fully resolve the desired subtle effect on the `.char-item` in dark mode for this specific case. (Task marked complete despite this minor visual issue).
- **Refactoring:** Using composables (`useGtfStore`, `useGlyphDisplay`) helps break down large components like `App.vue` and centralize logic. Ensure composables intended as singletons define their state *outside* the exported function.
- **Layout Debugging:** When `display: inline-block` isn't working as expected, check for conflicting `display` properties set dynamically in `:style` bindings or inherited from parent elements. Using wrapper elements can help isolate and control layout flow.

**NEW REFACTORING LESSONS:**
- **Bundle Size**: Current 546KB JS bundle indicates need for code splitting and tree shaking
- **Component Complexity**: Components over 200 lines become hard to maintain and test
- **State Management**: Inconsistent state patterns (store vs local refs) create confusion
- **Performance**: Heavy computed properties in templates cause unnecessary re-renders
- **CSS Architecture**: Scoped styles mixed with global styles make theming inconsistent
- **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded values scattered throughout make design changes difficult

**LARGE GLYPH PERFORMANCE LESSONS:**
- **DOM Limitations**: DOM-based rendering hits performance wall around 500-1000 elements
- **Canvas Advantages**: HTML5 Canvas can handle 10,000+ pixels with proper optimization
- **Hybrid Approach**: Best UX comes from intelligent switching between rendering modes
- **User Expectations**: Large glyph editing should feel as responsive as small glyph editing
- **Memory Patterns**: Large bitmap strings can cause GC pressure, typed arrays perform better
