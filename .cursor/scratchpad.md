# GTF Editor Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

- **Project Type:** Frontend application likely for editing GTF (Glyph/Font?) files.
- **Technology Stack:** Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify (UI library), Tauri (for potential desktop builds).
- **Initial Goal:** Understand the project structure, how to run it, and propose potential next steps or features.
- **Current State:** Basic understanding of the tech stack and how to run the development server (`npm run dev`) or Tauri app (`npm run tauri dev`) after `npm install`.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Understanding GTF:** (Status: Done)
- **Tauri Integration:** (Confirmed: Tauri is used for file dialogs and backend Rust logic.)
- **UI Implementation:** **(Update: Core UI components (Header Editor, Glyph Editor, Palette Editor, Bitmap Grid, File Ops, Language Check, Glyph List/Preview) are implemented and functional.)**
- **State Management:** (Update: State managed in `App.vue` via `ref` and computed properties, passed down via props, updates handled via emitted events. Seems functional for current features.)

- **Incomplete Features:** **(Update: Based on user feedback and re-evaluation, all core features including Bitmap Resizing seem to be implemented. Focus shifts to refinements and new features.)**
- **Defining "Beautiful/Vibrant/Alive":** These terms are subjective. We need to translate them into concrete design choices (colors, spacing, animations, interactions).
- **Technology Stack:** **(Confirmed: Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify 3)** The project uses Vite, Vue 3, and the Vuetify 3 component library. This means we should leverage Vuetify's theming capabilities (including built-in light/dark mode support) and potentially customize its components rather than starting CSS from scratch. Animations might be handled via Vuetify's transitions or custom CSS. The presence of Tauri suggests a desktop app context, which might influence some choices (e.g., native-like elements or custom).
- **Global Application:** Applying styles globally requires careful planning. Vuetify's theme system helps, but we need to ensure custom styles integrate well and don't conflict.
- **Theme Switching:** Vuetify provides mechanisms for theme switching, simplifying this task. We need to configure the light/dark palettes within Vuetify's theme settings.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Setup & Run:** Ensure the project can be installed (`npm install`) and run locally (`npm run dev`).
    - *Success Criteria:* The application loads successfully in the browser without errors.
2.  **Understand GTF Spec:** **(Done)**
    - *Success Criteria:* Be able to explain the basic structure and purpose of the GTF format. **(Achieved)**
3.  **Explore UI & Code:** **(Done - Re-analysis complete, confirming implementation status accurately)**
    - *Success Criteria:* Identify the main views/components and confirm implemented/missing features compared to `SPECIFICATION.md` and code analysis.
4.  **(UI Refinement Task) Redesign Language Check Dialog UI:** Improve the visual styling of the character grid in `LanguageCheckDialog.vue` to make it look less "flat" and more "organized".
    - *Success Criteria:* The character buttons have improved visual appeal (e.g., better spacing, depth/shadows, hover effects) addressing the user's feedback.
5.  **(UI Refinement Task) Verify Dark Mode Compatibility:** (Done - Considered complete despite known minor shadow issue)
    - *Success Criteria:* All UI elements have appropriate colors and contrast in both light and dark modes, leveraging Vuetify themes. (Met, with noted exception)
6.  **(Optional/Future) Implement Advanced Features & Refinements:**
    *   **Improved Language Check:** Add more languages or custom sets. (Task deferred - Marked complete by user request without further implementation)

## Lessons

*(Learnings and reusable notes will be documented here)*
- GTF v2 is a text format with HEADER/GLYPH blocks. Specification files: `glyph_format_spec_v2.md`, `SPECIFICATION.md`.
- Core parsing/saving logic exists in Rust (`src-tauri/src/gtf.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) via `load_gtf_file` and `save_gtf_file` Tauri commands.
- Visual bitmap editor `BitmapGrid.vue` IS implemented.
- `SPECIFICATION.md` checklist is outdated. **(Crucial: Need to read component logic AND function calls like `updateGlyphData` in `App.vue` thoroughly.)**
- File Ops (Open, Save, Save As, New File) implemented in `App.vue` / `FileOperations.vue`.
- Add/Remove Glyphs implemented in `App.vue`.
- Header/Glyph Metadata/Palette editing logic implemented via component events handled in `App.vue`.
- Sidebar glyph list provides Character Map/Overview functionality with grouping and preview (`App.vue`, `GlyphPreview.vue`).
- Bitmap resizing logic IS implemented (User confirmed).
- **All core spec features seem implemented.** Focus is now on refinement/new features.
- Identified frontend stack: Vue 3, Vite, Vuetify 3.
- Language check uses hardcoded sets in `App.vue`, interaction simplified to click-to-edit/add.
- Achieving consistent custom `box-shadow` appearance across light/dark themes is difficult. Vuetify's `elevation` classes are the preferred method, but didn't fully resolve the desired subtle effect on the `.char-item` in dark mode for this specific case. (Task marked complete despite this minor visual issue).
